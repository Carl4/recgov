# recgov
Python modules to interface with [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov/) in order
to find suitable availability.

## Usage:

In order to use this library, you'll need to [sign up](https://ridb.recreation.gov/) for
an api account.  Enabling developer access is under your account settings page.
You can either store the API KEY in your environment variables as `RECREATION_GOV_KEY`
or you can pass it to your `_session.get_session` calls (much trickier -- not really
supported).

To install from the checked out code:
``` bash
pip install .
```

To make a link in python to the current code-base:
```bash
pip install --editable .
```

# Generalizing the script:

[recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/) works a little different.  It has a
promising [documented API](https://www.recreation.gov/use-our-data) that provides
access to campground details, but it doesn't seem to include any availability data.

Common fields used across the api:
| Field Name        | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| asset_id          | The campground overall                            |
| name              | Campsite name (often a number)                    |
| org_name          | Who owns the campsite                             |
| loop              | The loop where you can find the site              |

The most promising undocumented endpoint is here:

* [Month](https://www.recreation.gov/api/camps/availability/campground/234059/month?start_date=2021-02-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z)
  * Gets availability for an entire month.

The response object looks something like this:
``` json
{
 "availabilities": {
  "2021-03-01T00:00:00Z": "Available",
  // . . . .
  "2021-03-05T00:00:00Z": "Reserved",
